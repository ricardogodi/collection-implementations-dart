# collection-implementations-dart
This is a short Dart library with an abstract Collection&lt;T> class and concrete BST&lt;T> and LinkedList&lt;T> subclasses. This project showcases object-oriented design with features like element addition, deep copying, in-order traversal, custom function mapping, indexing with bounds checking, and method chaining.
